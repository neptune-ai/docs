Using Experiments Dashboard
===========================

Neptune is a browser-enabled app that lets you visualize and browse experiments.

The **Experiments** space displays all the experiments in a specific Project in table form.

Filter experiments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can perform the simplest filtering by typing into the search fields:

You can also use the `Neptune Query Language <nql.html>`_ to filter experiments for more advanced criteria.

Organize experiments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several ways to organize your experiments:

- **Use tags**: You can create tag(s), which you assign to experiments. Later, you can quickly filter by these tags.

- **Customize views**: You can create a custom view of the dashboard. For example, you can filter rows by parameter or metric values and select a subset of useful columns. Then save the view and quickly return to it by selecting it from the list of views.

- **Choose columns**: You can configure several data types logged to Neptune so that they are displayed as columns in the dashboard. They are metrics, text logs, properties and parameters. However, **all** data can be seen in the **single** experiment view.

- **Group experiments**: You can group experiments by one or more column(s). The dashboard displays the selected columns, allowing you to make in-group and across-groups analysis of the experiments. Each group is represented by the first experiment that appears according to the sorting order. After opening it, each group shows at most 10 experiments - all experiments can be viewed by clicking **Show all**.
