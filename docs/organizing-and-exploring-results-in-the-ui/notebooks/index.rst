* You can browse checkpoints history across all `Notebooks in the project <https://ui.neptune.ai/shared/onboarding/notebooks>`_.
* You can `share <https://ui.neptune.ai/shared/onboarding/n/neural-style-tutorial-c96dce51-409a-4b1b-8dbf-c47d52868d9b/9a7f6736-8794-44f0-9060-cf1b451d92d9>`_ a Notebook as a link.
