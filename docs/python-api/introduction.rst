Neptune comes with open source Python library: |neptune-client-github|. The overall goal of the Neptune-client is to allow Users to log metadata of their Python scripts to Neptune server. In particular, this tool supports handful of use cases:

* creating and tracking experiments in a given project
* managing running experiment
* downloading files associated with experiment
* downloading experiments data and project related data
