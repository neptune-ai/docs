Log metrics to Neptune
----------------------
How to track multiple metrics (loss, scores) in the experiment?

Solution
^^^^^^^^
**Step 1: Log**

In order to log metrics to Neptune, you simply need to:

.. code-block::

   import neptune

   neptune.init('shared/onboarding')
   with neptune.create_experiment():
       # 'log_loss' is User defined metric name
       neptune.send_metric('log_loss', 0.753)
       neptune.send_metric('AUC', 0.95)

Another option is to log `key: value` pair like this:

.. code-block::

   neptune.set_property('model_score', '0.871')

.. note:: You can create as many metrics as you wish.

**Step 2: Analyze**

Browse and analyse your metrics on the dashboard (`example <https://app.neptune.ml/neptune-ml/Home-Credit-Default-Risk/experiments>`_) or in the particular experiment (`example experiment <https://app.neptune.ml/neptune-ml/Home-Credit-Default-Risk/e/HC-11860/channels>`_).

Log images to Neptune
---------------------
I generate model predictions after every epoch. How can I log them as images to Neptune?

Solution
^^^^^^^^
**Log single image to Neptune**

Create PIL image that you want to log. For example:

.. code-block::

   import imgaug as ia
   from PIL import Image

   img = ia.quokka()
   img_pil = Image.fromarray(img)

Log it to Neptune:

.. code-block::

   import neptune

   # This function assumes that NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN environment variable is defined.
   neptune.init(project_qualified_name='shared/onboarding')

   with neptune.create_experiment() as exp:
       exp.send_image('quokka', img_pil)

As a result, quokka image is associated with the experiment

.. image:: ../_static/images/how-to/ht-img-channel-1.png
   :target: ../_static/images/how-to/ht-img-channel-1.png
   :alt: image

**Log multiple images to neptune**

You can log images in a loop. For example, you can augment your image and log it to Neptune:

.. code-block::

   from imgaug import augmenters as iaa

   aug_seq = iaa.Affine(scale={"x": (0.8, 1.2), "y": (0.8, 1.2)},
                        translate_percent={"x": (-0.2, 0.2), "y": (-0.2, 0.2)},
                        rotate=(-25, 25),
                        )

   exp2 = neptune.create_experiment()
   for run in range(20):
       img_aug= aug_seq.augment_image(img)
       img_pil_aug = Image.fromarray(img_aug)
       exp2.send_image('quokka_version_{}'.format(run), img_pil_aug)

   exp2.close()

.. image:: ../_static/images/how-to/ht-img-channel-2.png
   :target: ../_static/images/how-to/ht-img-channel-2.png
   :alt: image

Save experiment output
----------------------
I can run my experiment but I am struggling to save the model weights and the ``csv`` file with the results when it completes. How can I do that in Neptune?

Solution
^^^^^^^^
Save everything as you go! For example:

.. code-block::

   with neptune.create_experiment() as exp:
       exp.send_artifact('/path/to/model_weights.h5')
       ...
       exp.send_artifact('/path/to/results.csv')

Your results will be available for you to download in the ``Output`` section of your experiment.

.. image:: ../_static/images/how-to/ht-output-download-1.png
   :target: ../_static/images/how-to/ht-output-download-1.png
   :alt: image

Specify experiment parameters
-----------------------------
I saw that Neptune logs experiment parameters.

.. image:: ../_static/images/how-to/ht-specify-params-1.png
   :target: ../_static/images/how-to/ht-specify-params-1.png
   :alt: image

But I don't know how to specify parameters for my experiments.

Solution
^^^^^^^^
You define your parameters at experiment creation, like this:

.. code-block::

   import neptune

   # This function assumes that NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN environment variable is defined.
   neptune.init('username/my_project')

   # check params argument
   with neptune.create_experiment(name='first-pytorch-ever',
                                  params={'dropout': 0.3,
                                          'lr': 0.01,
                                          'nr_epochs': 10}):
   # your training script

Where ``params`` is standard Python dict.

Version datasets
----------------
When working on a project, it is not unusual that I change the datasets on which I train my models. How can I keep track of that in Neptune?

Solution
^^^^^^^^
Under many circumstances it is possible to calculate a hash of your dataset. Even if you are working with large image datasets, you have some sort of a smaller metadata file, that points to image paths. If this is the case you should:

**Step 1**

Create hashing function. For example:

.. code-block::

   import hashlib

   def md5(fname):
       hash_md5 = hashlib.md5()
       with open(fname, "rb") as f:
           for chunk in iter(lambda: f.read(4096), b""):
               hash_md5.update(chunk)
       return hash_md5.hexdigest()

**Step 2**

Calculate the hash of your training data and send it to Neptune as text:

.. code-block::

   TRAIN_FILEPATH = 'PATH/TO/TRAIN/DATA'
   train_hash = md5(TRAIN_FILEPATH)

   neptune.send_text('train_data_version', train_hash)
   ...

**Step 3**

Add data version column to your project dashboard:

.. image:: ../_static/images/how-to/ht-data-version-1.png
   :target: ../_static/images/how-to/ht-data-version-1.png
   :alt: image

.. note:: If your dataset is too large for fast hashing you could think about rearranging your data to have a light-weight metadata file.

Keep my code private
--------------------
My code is proprietary, so I do not want to send any sources to Neptune, while training locally. How to do it?

Solution
^^^^^^^^
All you need to do it to pass empty list ``[]`` to the ``upload_source_files`` parameter, like this:

.. code-block::

   import neptune

   # This function assumes that NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN environment variable is defined.
   neptune.init(project_qualified_name='shared/onboarding')

   with neptune.create_experiment(upload_source_files=[]) as exp:
       ...

As a result you will not send sources to Neptune, so they will not be available in the Source Code tab in the Web app.

Upload notebook checkpoint
--------------------------
I want to add Notebook checkpoint to my project. How to do it?

Solution
^^^^^^^^
Go to your Jupyter, where you can see two Neptune buttons:

* **n** button is for configuration changes
* **Upload** button is for making checkpoint in Neptune

.. image:: ../_static/images/notebooks/buttons_02_1.png
   :target: ../_static/images/notebooks/buttons_02_1.png
   :alt: image

Click **Upload**, whenever you want to create new checkpoint in Neptune. You will see tooltip with link as a confirmation.

.. image:: ../_static/images/notebooks/buttons_03_1.png
   :target: ../_static/images/notebooks/buttons_03_1.png
   :alt: image

.. note:: You can use **Upload** as many times as you want.
