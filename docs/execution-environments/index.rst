Run Neptune anywhere
====================

You can run your experiments in any environment and log them to Neptune.
There are just two things you need to do:

- install Neptune client

    .. code:: bash

        pip install neptune-client

- add logging snippet to your scripts

    .. code:: python

        import neptune

        neptune.init(api_token='', # use your api token
                     project_qualified_name='') # use your project name
        neptune.create_experiment('my-experiment')
        # training logic
        neptune.log_metric('accuracy', 0.92)

.. note::

    if you are not using Python don't worry.
    Read how to:

    - :ref:`use Neptune with R <integrations-r>`
    - :ref:`use Neptune with any other language <integrations-any-language>`


.. _execution-use-environment-variables:

Environment variables
---------------------

Instead of passing `api_token` and `project_qualified_name` directly to `neptune.init()` you can use environment variables:

- `NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN`: where you put your Neptune API token

    .. code:: bash

        NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN='YOUR_API_TOKEN'

    .. note::

        It is recommended to keep your API token in the environment variable for security reasons.
        To see how to get api token read :ref:`how to get Neptune API token <how-to-setup-api-token>`.

- `NEPTUNE_PROJECT`: where you put your project qualified name

    .. code:: bash

        NEPTUNE_PROJECT='YOUR_QUALIFIED_PROJECT_NAME'

    .. note::

        Remember that project qualified name has two parts 'WORKSPACE/PROJECT_NAME' for example 'neptune-ai/credit-default-prediction'.
        Read :ref:`how to create a project here <create-project>`.
