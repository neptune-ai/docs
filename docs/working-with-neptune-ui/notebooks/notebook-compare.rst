The Notebooks Comparison pane lets you compare Notebook checkpoints.

You display the pane by clicking the **Compare** button anywhere it is visible in the Notebooks pane.

In the Notebooks Comparison pane, select two Notebook checkpoints, then click **Compare** to see a side-by-side comparison, just like source code.


.. Commented out. Doesn't seem to be working.
.. `Compare view <https://ui.neptune.ai/shared/onboarding/compare-notebooks>`_ let you look at the difference between checkpoints of the same Notebook, or two entirely different Notebooks (Try yourself `here <https://ui.neptune.ai/shared/onboarding/compare-notebooks>`_).


* Differences in code, markdown, output and execution count are highlighted.
* Summary information about the differences is displayed at the top of the pane.
