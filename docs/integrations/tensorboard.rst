|neptune-tensorboard| is an open source project curated by Neptune team, that integrates |tensorboard| with Neptune to let you get the best of both worlds.
We support two major use cases:

1. With |neptune-tensorboard| you can have your TensorBoard visualizations hosted in Neptune (see example: `TensorBoard runs comparison <tensorboard/tensorboard_runs_comparison.html>`_).
2. You can use ``neptune.integrate_with_tensorflow()`` method to instantly log major metrics (epoch and batch related) to Neptune (see example: `Integrate with TensorBoard logging <tensorboard/tensorboard_integrate.html>`_).

Check example project in Neptune: |tensorboard-integration|.

Quick-start
-----------
**Installation**

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install neptune-tensorboard

**Sync TensorBoard logdir with Neptune**

Point Neptune to your TensorBoard logs directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    neptune tensorboard /PATH/TO/TensorBoard_logdir --project USER_NAME/PROJECT_NAME

.. note:: That's it! You can now browse and collaborate on your TensorBoard runs in Neptune.

You can now organize your TensorBoard experiments:

.. image:: ../_static/images/tensorboard/tensorboard_1.png
   :target: ../_static/images/tensorboard/tensorboard_1.png
   :alt: organize TensorBoard experiments in Neptune

and compare your TensorBoard runs,

.. image:: ../_static/images/tensorboard/tensorboard_2.png
   :target: ../_static/images/tensorboard/tensorboard_2.png
   :alt: compare TensorBoard runs in Neptune

and share your work with others by sending an |experiment-link|.

Examples
----------
.. toctree::
