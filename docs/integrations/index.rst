Neptune comes with 25+ integrations with Python libraries popular in machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning.

How integrations work?
----------------------
Integrations are written using |neptune-client| and provide a convenient way to jump-start working with Neptune and a library that you are using. There is no need to integrate your code manually using neptune-client (it's easy though).

Each integration, that is installation, scope and usage example are explained in detail in the documentation (see: :ref:`PyTorch Lightning <integrations-pytorch-lightning>` for example).

Integrations are organized into the following categories:

- :ref:`Deep learning frameworks <integrations-deep-learning-frameworks>`
- :ref:`Machine learning frameworks <integrations-machine-learning-frameworks>`
- :ref:`Hyperparameter optimization libraries <integrations-hyperparameter-optimization-frameworks>`
- :ref:`Visualization libraries <integrations-visualization-tools>`
- :ref:`Experiment tracking frameworks <integrations-experiment-tracking-frameworks>`
- :ref:`Other integrations <integrations-other-integrations>`

.. note::

    You can always :ref:`use neptune-client to log data to experiments <guides-logging-and-managing-experiment-results>` .
    If you need more control or explicit logging, you can always use it (all integrations use it anyway).


My library is not here. What now?
---------------------------------
There are two common paths:

#. You can always use  |neptune-client| , our open source Python library for logging all kinds of data and metadata to experiments.
#. Contact us directly via mail (contact@neptune.ai), chat (that little thing in the lower right corner) or post |forum| on our forum to discuss what you need and how we can deliver it.
