Deployment Options
==================

Depending on the way you deploy your system, your experiment data can be hosted in Neptune servers or stored on your premises or cloud provider.

Hosted Deployment
-----------------

Using this configuration, you run your experiments wherever you want but send experiment logs to our servers on `neptune.ai`. This follows common SaaS platform practise. 

To get started, just |register| and follow the onboarding instructions.


On-premises Deployment
----------------------

In this configuration, we deploy the application on the infrastructure of your choice, including the backend, the frontend, and all your experiment data. In this mode, data never leaves your organization.

You can deploy Neptune on local servers or in any cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure or custom hardware).
