Organization types
==================

Organization is a way to centrally manage projects, users (and billing). Neptune has two organization types.

Individual
----------
* Each user is assigned individual organization with ``username`` as an organization name.
* User is the only member of this organization but may :ref:`invite collaborators <how-to_team-management_invite-to-project>` to projects.
* User can create unlimited number of projects in the individual organization.

Team
----
* Team organization comes handy when entire team needs to be managed centrally.
* Once :ref:`created <how-to_team-management_create-organization>`, team organization can be managed by :ref:`organization Admin <core-concepts_user-roles_organization-admin>`. This include users and billing.
* Only Users who joined team organization can browse its content, subject to assigned :ref:`role <core-concepts_user-roles>` in the organization or project.
