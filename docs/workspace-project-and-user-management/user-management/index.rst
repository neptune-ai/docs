User Roles
----------

There are user roles in projects and in workspaces.

Roles in a workspace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Workspace roles apply only to team workspaces.

If you have :ref:`created a Team workspace <how-to_team-management_create-workspace>`,
you can invite people to it. Two roles are available: Admin and Member.

The following table summarizes the permissions available for the workspace roles.

.. note::

    - An Admin of a workspace is also the Owner of all projects and can grant workspace ownership to anyone in the workspace.
    - Project Owners can grant project ownership to anyone in the workspace.
    - A workspace must have at least one Admin, so the last remaining Admin cannot be removed from the workspace.

.. _administration-user-roles-project:

The following table summarizes the permissions available for the three project roles: Owner, Contributor and Viewer.

- **Content** permissions refer to running experiments, creating Notebooks, and modifying previously stored data.
