Use Neptune API to Iog your first experiment
============================================

|run on colab button|

Introduction
------------

This guide will show you how to:

* Install neptune-client
* Connect Neptune to your script and create the first experiment
* Log metrics to Neptune and explore them in the UI

By the end of it, you will run your first experiment and see it in Neptune!

Before you start
----------------

Make sure you meet the following prerequisites before starting:

* Have Python 3.x installed

.. note::

    You can run this how-to on Google Colab with zero setup.

    Just click on the ``Open in Colab`` button on the top of the page.

Step 1 - Install neptune-client
-------------------------------

Go to the command line of your operating system and run the installation command:

.. code:: bash

    pip install neptune-client

.. note::

    If you are using R or any other language |go read this|.


Step 2 - Create a `quickstart.py`
---------------------------------

Create a python script called `quickstart.py` and copy the code below to it:

`quickstart.py`

.. code:: python

    # Connect your script to Neptune
    import neptune

    neptune.init(project_qualified_name='shared/onboarding',
                  api_token='ANONYMOUS',
                 )

    # Create experiment
    neptune.create_experiment()

    # Log metrics to experiment
    from time import sleep

    neptune.log_metric('single_metric', 0.62)

    for i in range(100):
        sleep(0.2) # to see logging live
        neptune.log_metric('random_training_metric', i * 0.6)
        neptune.log_metric('other_random_training_metric', i * 0.4)

|run on colab button|

.. note::

    Instead of logging data to the public project 'shared/onboarding' as an anonymous user 'neptuner' you can log it to your own project.

    1. Get your Neptune API token

       .. image:: ../../_static/images/getting-started/quick-starts/get_token.gif
          :target: ../../_static/images/getting-started/quick-starts/get_token.gif
          :alt: Get API token

    2. Pass the token to ``api_token`` argument of ``neptune.init()`` method: ``api_token=YOUR_API_TOKEN``
    3. Pass your username to the ``project_qualified_name`` argument of the ``neptune.init()`` method: ``project_qualified_name='YOUR_USERNAME/sandbox``.
       Keep ``/sandbox`` at the end, the ``sandbox`` project that was automatically created for you.

    For example:

    .. code:: python

        neptune.init(project_qualified_name='funky_steve/sandbox',
                     api_token='eyJhcGlfYW908fsdf23f940jiri0bn3085gh03riv03irn',
                    )


Step 3 - Run your script and explore results
--------------------------------------------

Now that you have your script ready you can run it and see results in Neptune.

Run your script from the terminal or Jupyter notebook

.. code:: bash

    python quickstart.py

Click on the link in the terminal or notebook or go directly to the Neptune app. 

See  metrics you logged in `Logs`, `Charts`, and hardware consumption in the `Monitoring` sections of the Neptune UI:

|Explore experiment|

Conclusion
----------

Youâ€™ve learned how to:

* Install neptune-client
* Connect Neptune to your python script and create an experiment
* Log metrics to Neptune
* Explore your metrics in ``Logs`` and ``Charts`` sections
* See hardware consumption during the experiment run
