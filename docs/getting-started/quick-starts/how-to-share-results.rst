How to share ML results with your team
======================================

.. note::

    "How to..." is coming soon. For now we have a video that explains it.

With Neptune you can have all your teamsâ€™ experiments and notebooks versioned in an app built for ML teams.

Run experiments anywhere, use any framework, have all the results in one place, send a link to share them.
