Integrating Neptune into your codebase
======================================

We've created a how-to guide to guide you through this step by step:

- |How to connect Neptune to your Python codebase step by step (5 min)|

If you are interested in connecting Neptune with a particular framework you can jump straight to our |Integrations|.

.. note::

    If you are not using Python no worries, you can still log experiments to Neptune.

    Read our guides on:

    - How to use |Neptune client for R|
    - How to log experiments for |any other language|
