Add Users to a Project
======================

.. note::

    Only a project Owner can invite new users to the project. Learn more about :ref:`project roles <core-concepts_user-roles_project-owner>`.

1. In the Project pane, click **Settings**, then click the **People** tab.


- The tab displays the list of project members who already belong to the project.
- Above the list is a field in which you can type an email or username of people you want to invite. Neptune identifies names and emails for people who already have an account.

2. Specify an email or username of a user you want to add.

3. Set a role and click **Invite**.

.. note::

    - If a user is registered in Neptune.ai, s(he) can be added from the UI, under **Project Settings** > **People**. If the user is not yet registered in Neptune.ai, s(he) can be invited by email. In any case, the user needs to accept the invitation, before s(he) appears in the list.
    - If the project is created in an individual workspace, you can only invite users to a public project. The user is notified by email and must accept the invitation to be added. You cannot add users to a private project.
