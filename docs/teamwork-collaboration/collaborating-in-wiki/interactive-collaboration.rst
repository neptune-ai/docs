Interactive collaboration
=========================

Collaborative editing
---------------------

You can edit Wiki pages collaboratively (think Google Docs).
In the figure shown here, four users are editing the Wiki page simultaneously.
Their avatars are displayed next to the title page.
Note that each user has one color associated with them.

so that it is also highlighted in green.
Another example, is the blue user -- her mouse cursor is next to the word “progress
